# COVID-19 Dashboard

This is the final project for course BIOSTAT 823 (Statistical Program for Big Data) at Duke University. The main accomplishment is a dashboard about COVID-19. The dashboard contains three sections:

- Overview
- By Country
- Economic Perspective

The dashboard is constructed through [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) and can be obtained by running the following code in the terminal:

```
streamlit run my_app.py
```

This dashboard is also deployed through Heroku at [this link](https://covid-19-823.herokuapp.com/).
