# COVID-19 Analysis

## Introduction
This is the final project for course BIOSTAT 823 (Statistical Program for Big Data) at Duke University. The major data products are a dashboard and a report about COVID-19. The relevant technologies are:

- Plotly
- Streamlit
- Flourish
- Heroku
- SQL (to extract data from AWS)
- Random Forest Regression
- Elastic Net Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- Grid Search Cross Validation Parameter Tuning

The dashboard can be obtained [here](https://covid-19-823.herokuapp.com/).

## Datasets

- **COVID-19 Datasets**
The COVID-19 datasets are from [Amazon Web Services (AWS) data lake](https://dj2taa9i652rf.cloudfront.net/). This database is a centralized repository of up-to-date and curated datasets about COVID-19.

- **Food Datasets**
The diet information and corresponding COVID-19 recovery rate data are from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset?select=Fat_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv).

- **Economic Datasets**
The economic impacts of COVID-19, represented by GDP growth rate of G20 or G7 countries, are provided by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).""")
